## Development of a Neural Network for the automated wood class identification using an RGB-LIDAR camera

Wood is becoming more widely recognized as a valuable renewable resource. With
the increasing demand for wood and the depletion of natural forests, it is essential to
find ways to use wood sustainably and efficiently. Recycling wood conserves natural
resources, reduces the amount of waste in landfills, and helps reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. Furthermore, wood can be recycled and repurposed into a variety of
products, from furniture to construction materials. In order to recycle the wood, It must
be classified into individual classes A1, A2, and A3. This project uses Mask-RCNN to
develop a neural network to classify wood using an RGB-LIDAR camera. An Instance
Segmentation model is developed for the classification of the wood. Using Mask-RCNN,
waste wood classes A1-A3 were identified with mean Average Precision of 65%.
